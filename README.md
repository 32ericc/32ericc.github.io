# About Me Website

## A website that displays a little about myself, made from everything I've gathered in the span of a month.

## Overview üìã
This website marks what I would consider my very first web development project. It exemplifies my strengths in frontend development, semantic HTML and CSS, and familiarizes 
me with the intricacies of backend development. I used many publicly available [resources](https://github.com/32ericc/32ericc.github.io/blob/main/resources.txt) to help me 
build the website. Some notable features include: horizontal scrolling, custom cursor, animated text, and a digital clock.

## Launch üöÄ
The website is not made suitable for older devices as well as mobile devices (it will run slowly due to the large amount of CSS). In the future I plan on making another 
site to fit those needs. For now, you can launch the website by heading to [this link](https://32ericc.github.io/) or cloning the repository to your local machine and 
starting a local server there.

## Timeline üë®‚Äçüíª
You may be wondering why most of my commits were made all at once. Well, prior to the project, I had a very small understanding of github and was in a time 
crunch, so I decided to document my progress in notepad instead. Shown below are the days that I have worked on the project and a short description of what 
I was able to accomplish on those days.
