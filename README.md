# About Me Website

## A website that displays a little about myself, made from everything I've gathered in the span of a month.

## Progress 👨‍💻
You may be wondering why most of my commits were made all at once. Well, prior to the project, I had a very small understanding of github and was in a time 
crunch, so I decided to document my progress in notepad. Shown below are the days that I have worked on the project and what I was able to accomplish on that 
given day.
